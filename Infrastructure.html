<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h2>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</h3>
<p>In energy domain, a simplified infrastructure topology of the system should be described in order to deliver intelligent services. The infrastructure topology facilitates the description of an infrastructure in a flexible way by allowing to describe the infrastructureâ€™s components and its relations. </p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Scope</h3>
<p>Infrastructure ontology provides OWL classes and properties to allow infrastructure of an energy system to be described.</p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h3>
<p>This Infrastructure Ontology helps to define the infrastructure system of OMEGA-X use cases. The main class is the system which can be a physical system, a virtual system, an equipment or a site. A system can have a system configuration encompassing different properties, in general defined from the data sheet or from an initial configuration of the system. New module can be created to define the infrastructure of a specific use case family. This new module should be aligned with the general infrastructure ontology.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/InfrastructureOntology/ValueSet/"><strong>infra:<em>System</em></strong></a>
A system may be an equipment, a site, or any other physical or virtual system. A system that is neither an equipment nor a site may be, for instance, an electric grid or a data analytics service available on a Dataspace.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/InfrastructureOntology/Equipment/"><strong>infra:Equipment</strong></a>
An equipement is a physical system which is part of the infrastructure.An equipment may be, for instance, an inverter or an electric vehicle charging station.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/InfrastructureOntology/Site/"><strong>infra:Site</strong></a>
A site is a part of the physical world or a virtual world that is inherently both located in this world and having a 3D spatial extent. It can include more than one equipment.A site may be, for instance, a solar plant or an electric vehicle charging station pool.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/InfrastructureOntology/SystemConfiguration/"><strong>infra:SystemConfiguration</strong></a>
A system configuration is a set of properties characterizing its structure and behavior. In case of an equipment, it may reflect its datasheet.</li>

<h1 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
<li>A <code>infra:System</code> can be an <code>eds:EvaluationPoint</code> (see <a href="../Energy Data Set Ontology"><em>EvaluationPoint</em></a> once an energy data set is attached to it. </li>
<li>The static attributes of an <code>infra:System</code> can be defined in <code>infra:SystemConfiguration</code>. </li>
<li>A <code>infra:System</code> can have a location. </li>
<li>A <code>infra:System</code> can consist of an another  <code>infra:System</code> or many  <code>infra:System</code>.</li>
<li>A An <code>infra:System</code> can be connected to another An <code>infra:System</code>. To precise the direction of the connection the object properties <code>infra:isConnectedTo</code> and An <code>infra:isConnectedFrom</code></li>
<li>For each specific use case family, a detailed infrastructure is defined to create the taxonomy of sites, equipements and static attributes, in addition to the relations between different systems.</li>
