<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h2>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</h3>
<p>In energy domain, a simplified infrastructure topology of the system should be described in order to deliver intelligent services. The infrastructure topology facilitates the description of an infrastructure in a flexible way by allowing to describe the infrastructureâ€™s components and its relations. </p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Scope</h3>
<p>Infrastructure ontology provides OWL classes and properties to allow infrastructure of an energy system to be described.</p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h3>
<p>This Infrastructure Ontology helps to define the infrastructure system of OMEGA-X use cases. The main class is the system 
which can be a system kind or a system of interest. System Kind  is an abstract class encompassing the taxonomy of inftastructure systems. A system of interest can be a physical system, a virtual system, an equipment or a site. It will be instatiated for each specific system, for e.g. LithiumBattery, Narbone solar plant..; It may have a system configuration encompassing different properties of intreset, in general defined from the data sheet or from an initial configuration of the system.</p>
<p>New module can be created to define the infrastructure of a specific use case family. This new module should be aligned with the general infrastructure ontology.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/System/"><strong>infra:<em>System</em></strong></a>
A system is an abstract class that can be a system of ineterest or a system kind. A system can be connected to another system. Moroever, a system can consist of other systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/SystemOfInterest/"><strong>infra:<em>SystemOfInterest</em></strong></a>
A system of intresest can be an equipment, a site, or any other physical or virtual system. A system of interest can have a system kind, a system configuration and/or a location.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/Kind/"><strong>infra:<em>SystemKind</em></strong></a>
The system kind classes describe the taxonomy of the energy infrastructure. More detailed view of this taxonomy is depicted in ......</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/Equipment/"><strong>infra:Equipment</strong></a>
An equipement is a physical system which is part of the infrastructure.An equipment may be, for instance, an inverter or an electric vehicle charging station.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/Site/"><strong>infra:Site</strong></a>
A site is a part of the physical world or a virtual world that is inherently both located in this world and having a 3D spatial extent. It can include more than one equipment.A site may be, for instance, a solar plant or an electric vehicle charging station pool.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3id.org/omega-x/ontology/Infrastructure/SystemConfiguration/"><strong>infra:SystemConfiguration</strong></a>
A system configuration is a set of properties of interest characterizing its structure and behavior. In case of an equipment, it may reflect its datasheet.</li>

<h1 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
<li>A <code>infra:SystemOfInterest</code> can be an <code>eds:EvaluationPoint</code> (see <a href="../Energy Data Set Ontology"><em>EvaluationPoint</em></a> once an energy data set is attached to it. </li>
<li>The static attributes of an <code>infra:Syste</code> can be defined in <code>infra:SystemConfiguration</code>. </li>
<li>A <code>infra:SystemOfInterest</code> can have a location. </li>
<li>A <code>infra:System</code> can consist of an another  <code>infra:System</code> or many  <code>infra:System</code>.</li>
<li>A An <code>infra:System</code> can be connected to another An <code>infra:System</code>. To precise the direction of the connection the object properties <code>infra:isConnectedTo</code> and An <code>infra:isConnectedFrom</code></li>
<li>Use case Families ontologies can create, specialize, and categorize system kinds.</li>
<li>System kinds can be organized in a taxonomy using object properties  skos:narrower and skos:broader.</li>
