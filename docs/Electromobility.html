<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h2>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</h3>
<p>The Electromobility ontology represents and organizes knowledge about the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. </p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Scope</h3>
<p>This ontology defines concepts and relations that are relevant to the charging infractrure - such as pool, station, charging point and connector- but do not cover electric vehicle characteritics. 
Roles of stakeholders of the charging infrastructure are further described in the ROLE ontology. Detailed characteristics of charging equipments and sites are given in the PROPERTY module.
Booking a charging point requires some knowledge on charging infrastructure, like location of the charging station pools, connector types available on a charging point...<br/>
Electromobility ontology provides OWL classes and properties to allow charging infrastructure to be described. The use of a charging infrastructure description facilitates the mutual understanding of electromobility players.</p>
<h3 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Contents</h3>
<p>This Electromobility Ontology contains four main classes:
- Electric Vehicle Charging Station Pool
- Electric Vehicle Charging Station
- Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)
- Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment  Connector</p>

<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Electric Vehicle Charging Station Pool: (source eMIP) A Charging Pool is a location where charging infrastructure elements can be found. A Charging Pool may contain several Charging Stations.</li>
<li>Electric Vehicle Charging Station: (source eMIP) A Charging Station is a physical element, visible for the users, on which Charging Points are available. The Charging Station is also the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) between the charge infrastructure and the end users.</li>
<li>Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE): (source eMIP) A Charging Point, synonym of EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment), is the energy supply element. An electrical vehicle can connect to a point on one of its connector. A Charging Point may have several Charging Connectors but only one vehicle could be charged at a time on a Charging Point.</li>
<li>Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) Connector: (source eMIP) A Connector related to an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) that connects to the electric vehicle for the purpose of charging. It is an interface to deliver electricity.</li>

<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>A qualified association should be used to assign the role played by a Stakaholder with regards to an electric vehicle charging station pool (see ROLE ontology).</li>
<li>When the property is static (never changes of value in time), its value should be contained in an individual of Property class (see PROP ontology).</li>
<li>When the property is dynamic (frequently changes of value in time), its value should be contained in an individual of ValueSet class (see ETS ontology).</li>
